      <h4>APPLICATIONS</h4>
      <p>Industrial applications - single task robots. Pick and place, etc.<br>Military applications - autonomous unmanned vehicles.<br>Space exploration - Curiosity rover on Mars, navigates the terrain on mars and sends feedback back to
          earth.<br>Healthcare - The da Vinci Surgical Robot, performs surgeries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item two">
      <h4>SCOPE</h4>
      <p>With the recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there is a tremendous scope for robotics in the future.<br>Big companies like Boston dynamics are heavily invested in hiring engineers who can solve problems
          using robotics</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item three">
      <h4>ADVANTAGES </h4>
      <p>Programming in python helps us in ease of implementation as the syntax is very easy to understand.<br>Python has so much legacy software available to users that one can find supporting libraries for his project. Therefore he/she can build
          upon the project instead or scratch coding the whole thing. <br>Python virtual machine enables us to program without worrying about memory management issues.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item four">
      <h4>LIMITATIONS </h4>
      <p>Due to the overhead and dependancies the code compilation is slower.<br>Takes a lot of space on a single board computer such as the raspberry pi pico as it has to run a virtual machine to run the code.</p>
